  <h2>Engine Architecture</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 70px; margin-right: 70px;"> 
    Our engine architecture cna be found under Class >> Class Hierarchy. This provides the inheritence of each class.
    It is also possible to see what functions each method calls in Call Function graphs within the documentation for each Class.
    Class documentation also features more detailed class UML diagrams.

  <h3>Alex</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 70px; margin-right: 70px;">
   The biggest thing I would improve/add to the engine given more time would be the ability to make multiple level saves and manage them from
   within the UI.  An extension of this would be making it so that the game could play multiple levels in sequence, instead of ending when you 
   win the loaded level.  The code could also do with being cleaned up to some extent, implementing some things with limited time meant 
   breaking the rules of good style (such as encapsulation).  It would also be good to add more types of enemies and collectibles, as well as
   more tile options for building levels.  Another improvement that could be implemented would be camera scrolling, so that you can have levels 
   larger than the window size
  </p>
  <h3>Claudia</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 70px; margin-right: 70px;">
    There are a few things that would improve our engine. One thing I would want to add is the ability to load and save multiple levels, and then
   creating UI for users to select which levels they would like to load. It would also be helpful to try to find ways users could export their
   individual games, similar to how Unity lets users export and build their final proejcts. More customizability would also be a goal, abstracting
   the GUI to take any spritesheet or list of spritesheets (most likely the same size) that the user would then be able to use to create their own
   levels. Our engine only supports 32X32 images at the moment too, so any user interface that would allow users to change the scale of their game
   would also be helpful. Currently our engine only supports a default camera / renders everything on one screen, so it would be cool to implement
   a moveable camera, with possible settings could set it to (fixed, following the plaayer, screen).
  </p>
  <h3>Justin</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 70px; margin-right: 70px;">
    There are a lot of things that I would do to make this engine better. I would add the ability to have different types of Enemy throughout the 
   level and control the aspects from within the gui for quick and precise level design. I also would add the ability to have multiple doors in the 
   level not just all of one type of block gets removed when all the collectibles are removed. Finally, After multi threading the python gui I really 
   want to experiment multi threading and hot to speed up the engine. Some other feature would be the ability to edit and add different sprites on the fly. 
   Create a level structure so when one is beaten it goes into the next. This can all be controlled by a gui that is open even before level. In this menu you 
   can go into a specific level from that gui. But this is all stuff I would do if I only had eight more weeks. If I had a whole summer I would add camera 
   panning, different abilities that the player could unlock and finally make a full game start to finish out of it.
